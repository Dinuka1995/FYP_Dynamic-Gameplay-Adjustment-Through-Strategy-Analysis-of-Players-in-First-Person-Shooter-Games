**Abstract**

Player modeling and Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) are widely studied areas which are proposed as solutions to increase the satisfaction of players in computer games. This research focuses on creating a DDA by using player modeling through strategy analysis on FPS games. After a thorough literature review and gaming community surveys two main strategies were identified as (i) Aggressive and (ii) Passive and their characteristics were defined. As the first part of this research, we propose relevant features and a method to efficiently classify the players strategy using logistic regression with a accuracy of 89\% for a test data set. As the second part, we propose a fuzzy based system to change the game parameters. The changing game parameters are weapon damage of the player, weapon damage of NPCs, weapon accuracy of NPCs, speed of NPCs, health decreasing factor of the player, maximum available ammunition, total NPC count and maximum NPC count in one spawn location. Finally, an experiment was conducted with 40 randomly assigned people. Each person played the game with and without the DDA system. 32 people gave a positive feedback about the new DDA system and 8 people mentioned that there were no significant difference.
